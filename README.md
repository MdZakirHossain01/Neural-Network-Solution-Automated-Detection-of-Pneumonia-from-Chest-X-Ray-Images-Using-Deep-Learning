# Neural Network Solution - Automated Detection of Pneumonia from Chest X-Ray Images Using Deep Learning

## Overview
This project aims to develop a neural network solution for the automated detection of pneumonia from chest X-ray images using deep learning techniques. The primary goal is to create a robust model that can accurately classify chest X-ray images into pneumonia and non-pneumonia categories.

## Repository Structure
