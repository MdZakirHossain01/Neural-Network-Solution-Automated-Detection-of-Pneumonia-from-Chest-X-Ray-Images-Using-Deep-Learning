# Neural Network Solution - Automated Detection of Pneumonia from Chest X-Ray Images Using Deep Learning

## Overview
This project aims to develop a neural network solution for the automated detection of pneumonia from chest X-ray images using deep learning techniques. The primary goal is to create a robust model that can accurately classify chest X-ray images into pneumonia and non-pneumonia categories.

## Repository Structure
- `Neural Network Solution-Automated Detection of Pneumonia from Chest X-Ray Images Using Deep Learning.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete code for data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
